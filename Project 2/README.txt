This project involves designing an internet site for selling a classical music CD collection online, where customers submit valuations for each CD and the site maximizes revenue by assigning CDs to customers at advantageous prices while ensuring every customer receives at most one CD. The objective is to create a Linear Integer Programming Model to solve this optimization problem, considering different scenarios of customers and CDs.
